# OOP in C++

## Overview

Welcome to my personal learning repository on Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in C++. This repository serves as a comprehensive collection of the code and concepts I have learned and implemented during my journey to understand OOP in C++. The primary objective of this repository is to keep a record of my learning progress and to have a reference point for future projects.

## Learning Journey

Throughout this learning experience, I have explored and implemented various fundamental and advanced concepts of OOP in C++. The key topics covered include:

- **Classes and Objects**: Understanding the basics of classes and objects, encapsulation, and the importance of data hiding.
- **Inheritance**: Exploring different types of inheritance (single, multiple, hierarchical, multilevel, and hybrid) and how they help in code reusability and organization.
- **Polymorphism**: Implementing function overloading and operator overloading, as well as runtime polymorphism through virtual functions and abstract classes.
- **Encapsulation**: Ensuring data security and hiding implementation details through access specifiers (private, protected, and public).
- **Abstraction**: Simplifying complex systems by modeling classes appropriate to the problem domain.
- **Constructors and Destructors**: Learning about the creation and destruction of objects and how constructors and destructors play a vital role in resource management.
- **Friend Functions and Friend Classes**: Understanding their usage and when to use them appropriately.
- **Templates**: Implementing generic programming through function templates and class templates.
- **Exception Handling**: Writing robust code with proper error handling mechanisms using try, catch, and throw blocks.
- **Standard Template Library (STL)**: Utilizing the powerful features of STL, including vectors, lists, maps, and algorithms.

Each section of this repository contains well-documented code examples and exercises that I have worked on to reinforce my understanding of the respective topics. The goal is to create a robust and reusable codebase that demonstrates my grasp of OOP principles in C++.

Feel free to explore the code, and I hope it serves as a useful reference for anyone looking to understand or revisit OOP concepts in C++. If you have any suggestions or improvements, I am open to feedback!
